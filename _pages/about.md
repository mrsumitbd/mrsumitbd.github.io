I am a PhD Candidate in Software Engineering at **Concordia University** in Montreal, Canada. I am also a trainee in the **CREATE SE4AI** program.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Machine Learning**, with a specific focus on detecting code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). I am currently working on building universal and interpretable detection tools to ensure the integrity of software ecosystems in the era of AI-generated code.

Previously, I have worked on software testing and automated repair. I am a strong advocate for open science and reproducible research. When I am not coding (usually in **Python**), you can find me exploring the streets of Toronto and Montreal with my camera.
