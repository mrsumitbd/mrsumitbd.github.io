<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am a PhD Candidate in Software Engineering at **Concordia University** in Montreal, Canada, and a trainee in the **CREATE SE4AI** program. My research lies at the intersection of **Software Engineering** and **Machine Learning**, specifically focusing on building universal, interpretable tools to detect code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

Beyond research, I have a background in industry and education, having served as a Lead Data Science Instructor at **General Assembly** and an AI Engineer at **Pentavere**. I am a strong advocate for open science, sustainable technology, and education for all.

When I am not coding (usually in **Python**) or writing, I am a proud father to a three-year-old. You can often find me exploring the streets of Toronto and Montreal with my camera, or planning a pilgrimage to Mecca, Medina, or perhaps a culinary trip to Japan.
