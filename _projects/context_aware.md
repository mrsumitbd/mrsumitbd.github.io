This project explores how **Context**—specifically environment configurations and dependency versions—affects the code generated by Large Language Models.

### Research Questions
* How do variations in prompt context change the functional correctness of generated code?
* Can we fine-tune models to be "environment-aware," reducing the rate of build failures and runtime errors in AI-generated software?

This work builds upon my recent findings regarding the instability of AI-enabled systems under different environment configurations.
