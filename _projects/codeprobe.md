**CodeProbe** is a proposed framework for the universal detection of LLM-generated code.

### The Challenge
Current detectors rely heavily on "black-box" machine learning models that lack interpretability and struggle with out-of-distribution data.

### Our Approach
We are investigating the use of **Knowledge Units (KUs)**—atomic representations of coding patterns—to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated code. By analyzing the density and distribution of these units, CodeProbe aims to provide a detection method that is both highly accurate and human-interpretable.
