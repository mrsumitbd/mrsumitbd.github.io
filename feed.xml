We found that while accuracy <em>can</em> drop (in ~23% of cases), the real danger is <strong>Instability in Time and Cost</strong>. Changing your environment configuration can silently double your processing time or cloud costs in nearly <strong>100% of cases</strong>, without you realizing it until the bill arrives.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2> <p>“It works on my machine” is the classic developer excuse. In traditional software, if the environment changes (e.g., different OS), the code usually crashes immediately.</p> <p>But AI systems are “non-deterministic.” If you change the underlying hardware (CPU architecture) or the software stack (Python version, OS), the system might not crash. Instead, it might:</p> <ol> <li>Give slightly different predictions (Model Instability).</li> <li>Take twice as long to run (Time Instability).</li> <li>Cost significantly more to compute (Expense Instability).</li> </ol> <p>We wanted to know: <strong>Which of these actually happens, and how bad is it?</strong></p> <h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2> <p>We conducted an extensive empirical study using <strong>Travis CI</strong>.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Subjects:</strong> 30 Open Source AI-enabled systems.</li> <li><strong>Variables:</strong> We permuted 8 different environment configurations, changing the <strong>Operating System</strong> (Linux vs. macOS), <strong>Python Version</strong>, and <strong>CPU Architecture</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Metrics:</strong> We measured shifts in Model Performance (accuracy), Processing Time, and Total Expense.</li> </ul> <h2 id="key-results">Key Results</h2> <p>Our findings were surprising. Most people expect the model to “break” (lose accuracy), but that wasn’t the biggest issue.</p> <ol> <li><strong>Accuracy is (Mostly) Safe:</strong> When switching from Linux to macOS, only <strong>23%</strong> of projects saw a significant change in model performance.</li> <li><strong>Time is Volatile:</strong> <strong>96.67%</strong> of projects experienced significant instability in processing time. A model that runs fast on Linux might crawl on macOS.</li> <li><strong>Cost is Guaranteed to Change:</strong> <strong>100%</strong> of the studied projects saw expense instability.</li> </ol> <h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2> <p>For <strong>DevOps Engineers and ML Practitioners</strong>, this is a wake-up call.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Don’t just check accuracy:</strong> Passing your unit tests isn’t enough.

We found that this is mostly an illusion caused by rigid syntax like semicolons and braces. When you strip those away, code is only slightly more repetitive than technical English. However, <strong>API usages</strong> remain highly predictable, suggesting that future AI tools should focus on graphs of API calls rather than simple text prediction.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2> <p>In 2012, a groundbreaking study coined the term “Natural Software,” showing that code is highly repetitive—much more so than English text. This led to a boom in statistical tools that treat code like text (e.g., n-gram models for autocompletion).</p> <p>But here is the catch: <strong>Code has strict grammar rules.</strong> If a tool predicts a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> at the end of a line, is it really “understanding” your code, or just following a rule? We suspected that existing models were “cheating” by predicting easy syntax tokens rather than meaningful logic.</p> <h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2> <p>We revisited the original study but added a twist. We analyzed 134 open-source projects across 7 languages (Java, C, Python, Ruby, etc.) and technical discussions from StackOverflow.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We replicated the original n-gram experiments to establish a baseline.</li> <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> We systematically removed “SyntaxTokens” (separators, operators, keywords) to measure the “true” entropy of the logic.</li> <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> We compared sequential models (n-grams) against <strong>Graph-based Object Usage Models (GROUMs)</strong> to see if graphs captured patterns better.</li> </ul> <h2 id="key-results">Key Results</h2> <p>Our data tells a different story about code repetitiveness:</p> <ol> <li><strong>It’s the Syntax:</strong> When we removed syntax tokens (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">}</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code>), the “unnatural” repetitiveness of code dropped distinctively. [cite_start]Java code without syntax is only ~10-20% more repetitive than technical English on StackOverflow[cite: 238, 250].</li> <li><strong>APIs are Key:</strong> While general code isn’t super repetitive, <strong>API usages</strong> are. [cite_start]Using a file input stream looks almost identical across thousands of different projects[cite: 252, 284].</li> <li><strong>Graphs Win:</strong> Compilers don’t read code left-to-right, and neither should AI. [cite_start]We found that <strong>graph representations</strong> of code were significantly more repetitive (predictable) than text sequences, capturing relationships that n-grams miss[cite: 378, 403].</li> </ol> <h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2> <p>For software engineers and tool builders, this changes how we build intelligent assistants:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stop predicting semicolons:</strong> Tools should focus on “high-value” predictions, like API calls and method chains, rather than syntax that a compiler can fix.</li> <li><strong>Think in Graphs:</strong> Since graphs capture more signal than text, the next generation of “Copilots” should leverage structural information (Data/Control flow) rather than just treating code as a sequence of words.</li> </ul> <h2 id="resources">Resources</h2> <ul> <li><a href="http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~pcr/paper/Rahman2019ICSE-draft.pdf">📄 Read the Paper (PDF)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5016gelg8tx5yx/README.md?dl=0">💻 Replication Package</a></li> </ul> <hr/> <hr/> <details> <summary><strong>Cite the paper</strong></summary> <br/> <pre><code>@inproceedings{rahman2019natural,<br />
